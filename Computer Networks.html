                     Explore the basics of computer networks, including network architecture, topology, protocols, and the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. Understand the roles of devices such as routers, switches, hubs, and gateways in network communication.<br>
                    
                    Data Link Layer:<br>
                     Grasp the concepts of the data link layer, which governs the transmission of data between adjacent network nodes. Learn about framing, error detection and correction, flow control, and media access control (MAC) protocols such as Ethernet.<br>
                    
                    Network Layer:<br>
                     Understand the network layer's role in routing and forwarding packets across interconnected networks. Explore Internet Protocol (IP) addressing, routing algorithms, IP forwarding, and protocols such as IPv4 and IPv6.<br>
                    
                    Transport Layer:<br>
                     Dive into the transport layer, responsible for end-to-end communication between applications. Learn about connection-oriented and connectionless communication, reliable data transfer, congestion control, and protocols such as TCP and UDP.<br>
                    
                    Application Layer:<br>
                     Explore the application layer, which enables networked applications to communicate over the network. Learn about common application layer protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, and their role in web, email, and file transfer services.<br>
                    
                    Advanced Topics:<br>
                    
                    Wireless and Mobile Networking:<br>
                     Gain insights into wireless and mobile networking technologies, including Wi-Fi, cellular networks, Bluetooth, and mobile IP. Understand the challenges and design considerations for building reliable and efficient wireless communication systems.<br>
                    
                    Network Security:<br>
                     Delve into network security principles and techniques for protecting networked systems from threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks. Learn about cryptographic algorithms, authentication, access control, and intrusion detection/prevention systems.<br>
                    
                    Quality of Service (QoS): <br>
                    Explore quality of service mechanisms for ensuring reliable and predictable network performance. Learn about traffic shaping, prioritization, and scheduling techniques for optimizing bandwidth utilization and minimizing latency in networked applications.<br>
                    
                    Software-Defined Networking (SDN): <br>
                    Understand the principles of software-defined networking and its impact on network architecture and management. Learn about SDN controllers, network virtualization, and programmable network infrastructure for dynamic and flexible network provisioning.
                    
                    Network Management and Monitoring:<br>
                     Grasp the fundamentals of network management and monitoring tools and techniques for diagnosing and troubleshooting network issues. Learn about network management protocols such as SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) and tools for network performance analysis and monitoring.<br>
                    
                    Practical Projects and Lab Exercises:<br>

                    Engage in practical projects and lab exercises to reinforce theoretical concepts and develop hands-on skills in network configuration, troubleshooting, and optimization. From setting up local area networks (LANs) and configuring routers and switches to analyzing network traffic and implementing security measures, practical experience is essential for mastering computer networks.<br>
                    
                    Conclusion:<br>
